# CycleX - Riding Safe

Riding safely with Virtual Reality.
CycleX is an interactive application that makes use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology that aims to instill safe cycling practices into both cyclists and non-cyclists who may not necessarily be well aware of the cycling rules and ethics. CycleX hopes to achieve this by allowing the users to go through an immersive virtual experience and decide on their actions through a series of scenarios from the perspective of a cyclist and/or pedestrian.

## FAQ

**If internet connection is required, does that mean it's multiplayer?** 

Unfortunately at its current development stage, CycleX is a single player simulation. Internet connection is required to be able to connect to some libraries for it to work.

**Do I need any special equipment to run CycleX?**

Not at all. You can run CycleX either from your laptop or mobile device. The only thing required is a VR-supported browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

**How much does it cost?**

Nothing!
